### [A_PI](https://github.com/clarkscoberly/A_PI) (Asset Private Investigator)
Personal Project done with two others for a hackathon. The rules: We had 24 hours to program as much as possible a project that we had previously researched and gotten "sponsership" from a company in the local area. It was to be done for free.\
In order to provide greater security for customers of Frontline Cyber Solutions they have asked us to gather information using a system they have in place to put together a database which can be queried for information on what systems are accessing or attempting to access their networks, small or large. 

###### Description/Significance:  
- Software that looks at traffic within a clientâ€™s network and logs what assets/devices are connecting then reads them into a database for future queries 
- Classify assets 
- PC, MAC, laptop, printer, tablet
- IP Address, Mac Address
- Type of OS being used 
- Operational Tech devices 
- Pull data off them. Store in a database. Make it easily accessible. \
Though we were not able to determine everything about the devices that were on the network we did create something that was a lot less harsh on the network vs something like **nmap** and were still able to gather much about who, how many, and generally on what they were on the network with.

##### Major Technologies Utilized
